# Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for CNN and any other Nural Network

Welcome to the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) repository! This Python module implements the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. It is designed for optimizing hyperparameters in machine learning models.

## Features

- **Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm**: Implements the GWO algorithm for parameter optimization.
- **Customizable Objective Function**: Allows for optimization of various functions.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple to integrate with existing machine learning models.

## Installation

To use the Grey Wolf Optimizer, you need to have Python and the necessary packages installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
